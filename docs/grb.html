    <h1>Gamma-Ray Bursts as Cosmological Probes</h1>

    <p>
      My research focuses on the calibration of long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) as
      high-redshift cosmological probes, with particular emphasis on machine-learning–
      based approaches and Bayesian inference.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p>
      GRBs extend well beyond the redshift reach of Type Ia supernovae, but their
      intrinsic luminosity dispersion and the associated circularity problem limit
      direct cosmological application. Robust calibration methods are therefore
      essential for extracting reliable cosmological constraints.
    </p>

    <h2>Machine-Learning–Based Calibration</h2>

    <p>
      Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) were
      developed to reconstruct the Hubble parameter and calibrate GRB luminosity
      correlations without assuming a fiducial cosmological model.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bayesian Neural Networks enable direct propagation of epistemic uncertainty
      into reconstructed observables, providing statistically consistent error
      estimates for subsequent cosmological inference.
    </p>

    <h2>Bayesian Inference and Cosmological Constraints</h2>

    <p>
      Calibrated GRB correlations were incorporated into cosmological likelihoods
      to test dark-energy models and assess sensitivity to key cosmological parameters.
      Multiple calibration strategies were compared to quantify their impact on
      inferred cosmology.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>

    <p>
      A manuscript detailing the machine-learning–based calibration framework and the
      resulting cosmological constraints has been submitted to arXiv.
